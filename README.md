This repository contains the code used in "A Systematic Assessment of Deep Learning Models for Molecule Generation".

# Overview
The folders whose names begin with the "\_" character contain all the code and useful files to test all the models.
The others are the folders that contain the original models. For more information on each model, you need to view the READMI file within each folder.
