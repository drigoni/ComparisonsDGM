# ComparisonsDGM
This repository contains the code used in "A Systematic Assessment of Deep Learning Models for Molecule Generation".

# Overview
The folders whose names begin with the "\_" character contain all the code and useful files to test all the models.
The others are the folders that contain the original models. For more information about each model, you need to view the `READMI.md` file within each folder.

# Dependencies
This project uses the `conda` environment.
In the `_environment` folder you can find, for each model, the `.yml` file for the configuration of the `conda` environment and also the `.txt` files for the `pip` environment. 
Note that some versions of the dependencies can generate problems in the configuration of the environment. For this reason, although the `setup.bash` file is present for the configuration of each project, it is better to configure them manually.

# Structure
The project is structured as follows: 
* `_analysis`: contains the code to execute to test the molecules generated by the models. It also contains the code to analyze the datasets;
* `_datasets`: contains the datasets QM9 and ZINC;
* `_environments`: contains the file `setup.bash` used to configure each environment;
* `_utils`: contains all the utility code used.

# Usage
### Data Download
First you need to download the necessary files by running the following commands:
```bash
cd _dataset/QM9
sh download_dataset.sh
```
### Model Training
For training and molecule generation it is necessary to execute the model code in the appropriate folders.
Remember to add the reading and saving functions of the moelcules to each new model accordingly to the other models.

### Model Test
Once the molecules have been generated with a model and saved in the `molecules.txt` file, you can use the files in the `_analysis/models` folder to calculate the they're properties.
File `model_results_generation.py` analyzes the molecules generated by sampling from the laten space ne wmolecules, while `model_results_bias.py` performs the reconstruction analysis.

Example given `$path` the full path to the `ComparisonsDGM` folder, and `$my_folder` the name of the folder where to save the results:
```bash
conda activate analysis
cd _analysis/models
python model_results_bias.py $my_folder $path/gVAE/results/qm9_vae_str_L56_E100_val_decRes.txt qm9
```
The results will be reported in folder `$path/_analysis/models/[bias, generation]/$my_folder/`.
